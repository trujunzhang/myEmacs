;;; Leader key
;;; In order to define an use a <leader> prefix for your personal shortcuts you have to install the package evil-leader and put lines like these on your .emacs (I use comma as a leader key):

(require 'evil-leader)

(global-evil-leader-mode)
(evil-leader/set-leader ",")

;;; Later, I found that the key didnâ€™t work on some modes (like when editing the .emacs file in emacs-lisp-mode), but the package FAQ solved the problem, you have to add this before the global-evil-leader-mode setting:

(setq evil-leader/in-all-states 1)
